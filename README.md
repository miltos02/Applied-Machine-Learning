# Applied Machine Learning

This repository includes two projects:   
   
**Project 1: Exploring AirBnB in Europe**, where data from Inside AirBnB for the last 12 months is analyzed to study listings and their impacts on housing, pricing, and tourism, and    

**Project 2: Social Media Sanctions and Misinformation**, where **mosleh_et_al_data.csv** is examined following Mosleh et al. (Nature) to determine whether sanctions are politically biased, with results suggesting that higher sanctions for conservatives are associated with more misinformation sharing rather than platform bias.
