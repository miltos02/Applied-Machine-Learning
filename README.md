# Applied Machine Learning

This repository includes two projects:  
**Project 1: Exploring AirBnB in Europe**, where we use Inside AirBnB data from the last 12 months to analyze listings and their impacts on housing, pricing, and tourism, and,   
**Project 2: Social Media Sanctions and Misinformation**, where using **mosleh_et_al_data.csv** and following Mosleh et al. (Nature), we examine whether sanctions are politically biased, finding that higher sanctions for conservatives are linked to more misinformation sharing rather than platform bias.
